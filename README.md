Does analysis on coupon acceptance rates based on different attributes.
Visualizing the Journey
We didn't just crunch numbers; we visualized them to bring the story to life. Each image below is a snapshot, a moment of insight into the complex decision-making process of drivers like you and me.

Proportion of Acceptance for Restaurant Coupons
We started by looking at the big picture: How many coupons were accepted overall? This pie chart provides a clear, visual representation of acceptance versus rejection.

The Income Factor
Does having a fuller wallet mean you're more likely to snag that deal? We compared acceptance rates between different income levels and visualized the findings in a bar chart that speaks volumes.

Age and Acceptance
Are younger drivers more adventurous or deal-savvy? We plotted acceptance rates across age groups to uncover who's really seizing those savings.

The Company You Keep
Does driving with your spouse influence your likelihood to accept a coupon? We dived into this personal aspect and brought back some intriguing insights.

A Combined View
Life isn't just one factor at a time. We combined various scenarios to give a richer, more nuanced understanding of what drives coupon acceptance.

Concluding Thoughts
Our analysis revealed layers of human behavior and preferences. For instance, it seems that among the lowest rates found for accepting a coupon for a nice restaurant in the $20 to $50 range were drivers who were older, not accompanied by their partner, and infrequent visitors to such establishments. On the flip side, the highest rates of acceptance were found in drivers seated next to their partners, frequenting these restaurants, and below the age of 30. Interestingly, income didn't sway the acceptance rate as much as one might expect, only nudging it from 37% for the lower-income bracket to 49% for the higher-income earners.
